# Kingdomino

This project is to experiment with machine learning.

The project will consist of phases:

1. POC: Code a very basic working automated 2 player game, playing first legal position found.
2. Refactor the code to improve quality and prepare for later phases.
3. Brute force mechanism to find the best position to play a tile, using the current score.
4. Use machine learning to improve the algorithm.

Currently the project is in Phase 1 and was coded in 24 hours, so there are lots of areas to improve the code.
